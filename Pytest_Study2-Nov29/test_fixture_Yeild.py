# The purpose of test fixtures is to provide a fixed baseline upon which tests can reliably and repeatedly execute

# @pytest.fixture()
# executes specific method before every test method

# @pytest.yield_fixture()
# Executed specific method before and after every test method

# Use @pytest.fixture instead; they are the same.
